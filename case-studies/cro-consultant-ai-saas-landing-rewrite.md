# Case 1.3 — CRO Consultant Rewrite for an AI SaaS Landing Page
**Role:** Growth / CRO Consultant  
**Industry:** AI-powered SaaS (reporting / analytics)

## Objective
Increase trial/demo conversion by improving first-5-second clarity, trust signals, and CTA specificity — without changing the product or adding paid ads.

## Problem Diagnosis
### 1) Value Proposition (First 5 seconds)
- Likely too abstract (AI buzzwords, unclear outcome)
- Unclear “who it’s for” and “what it replaces”

### 2) Trust & Proof
- Missing or weak credibility cues (logos, numbers, testimonials)
- High perceived risk for AI tools (accuracy, privacy, integration)

### 3) CTA Friction
- CTA vague (“Get started”) instead of a concrete step (“Book a 15-min demo”)
- No expectation-setting (time, requirements, what happens next)

## Proposed Copy (Version A — Risk Reduction)
**Headline:** “AI reports your team can trust — in minutes, not days.”  
**Subheadline:** “Connect your data sources, generate client-ready dashboards, and keep full control over what gets shared.”  
**Primary CTA:** “Book a 15-minute demo”  
**Secondary CTA:** “See example report”

**Proof Block (suggested):**
- “Used by X teams” (or replace with a non-fake placeholder)
- 1 short testimonial template (to be replaced with real quote)

## Proposed Copy (Version B — Outcome/ROI)
**Headline:** “Ship weekly reporting 5× faster with AI-assisted automation.”  
**Subheadline:** “Reduce manual dashboards, standardize insights, and give stakeholders clear answers—every week.”  
**Primary CTA:** “Start a free trial”  
**Secondary CTA:** “Calculate time saved”

## Experiment Plan (2-week)
### Hypotheses
- H1: Clearer “who/what/outcome” improves CTA clicks
- H2: Stronger proof reduces bounce and increases form completion

### Metrics
- Primary: trial/demo conversion rate
- Secondary: CTA click-through rate, bounce rate, scroll depth

### Test Design
- A/B test: current vs Version A vs Version B
- Keep page layout constant; change only above-the-fold + proof + CTA

## Deliverable
A conversion-ready copy set (2 variants) + test hypotheses + measurement plan.
