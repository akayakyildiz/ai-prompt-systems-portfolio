# Case 1.2 — AI CRO Workflow (Marketing Tool)

**Outcome:**  
A reusable AI-driven CRO workflow that turns qualitative inputs into scored insights, controlled rewrites, and A/B-test-ready variants — enabling marketing and growth teams to move from intuition to repeatable decisions.

---

## 1) Context

Marketing and growth teams were producing frequent copy iterations, but decisions were:
- subjective,
- difficult to justify internally,
- and hard to turn into structured experiments.

There was no consistent system to evaluate ideas, prioritize changes, or explain *why* a variant existed.

**Primary goal:**  
Create a decision workflow that standardizes CRO thinking across teams.

**Secondary goal:**  
Ensure all outputs are immediately usable in A/B testing tools.

## 2) My Role

**Role:** AI Product Consultant / CRO Systems Designer  

I designed an end-to-end CRO workflow that translates raw qualitative input into structured, test-ready outputs using prompt-driven logic.

The workflow replaces ad-hoc copy changes with a controlled, explainable process.

## 3) Workflow Design

The system operates in four stages:

1. **Intake**  
   - Page URL or copy block  
   - Target audience / ICP  
   - Conversion goal  
   - Constraints (no redesign, brand tone, legal limits)

2. **Scoring & Diagnosis**  
   Each element is evaluated against CRO criteria:
   - Value proposition clarity  
   - Proof & credibility  
   - Friction & commitment level  
   - CTA specificity  

   Outputs include:
   - Strengths / weaknesses
   - Ranked conversion blockers

3. **Controlled Rewrite**  
   Instead of freeform rewriting:
   - Each change is tied to a specific blocker
   - Each variant includes a clear hypothesis

4. **A/B-Ready Variants**  
   Final outputs include:
   - Variant A / B copy
   - Hypothesis per variant
   - Primary metric to measure impact

## 4) Example Output

- Diagnosed issue: Low value clarity in hero section  
- Hypothesis: Clarifying *who this is for* will increase CTA clicks  
- Variant B: Explicit ICP-focused headline  
- Metric: Hero CTA click-through rate

---

## 5) Why This Matters

- Eliminates subjective CRO debates  
- Makes decisions reviewable and explainable  
- Allows non-CRO teams to run disciplined experiments  
- Scales across products and teams

---

## 6) Professional Notes

- The workflow is intentionally modular  
- Prompts are designed as decision tools, not copy generators  
- All outputs are framed as testable hypotheses

## 8) Next Improvements (Optional)

- Add automated prioritization scoring  
- Connect to experiment results for feedback loops  
- Package as an internal CRO assistant for teams
