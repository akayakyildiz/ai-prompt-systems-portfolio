# Case 1.2 — AI CRO Workflow for a Marketing Tool Landing Page
**Role:** AI Product Consultant  
**Industry:** Marketing / Growth Tool

## Problem
A feature-rich marketing tool landing page generated interest but conversion was inconsistent. The team lacked a repeatable CRO process and relied on ad-hoc rewrites.

## Context
- Audience: marketers and growth teams
- Constraints:
  - Copy must work organically (no paid ads assumptions)
  - Weekly iteration cadence (repeatable workflow)
  - Easy execution for non-writers

## Solution (Workflow System)
### Step 1 — Intake (inputs)
- Primary persona + job-to-be-done
- Primary CTA (trial/demo)
- Top 3 objections
- Current copy (headline, subheadline, key sections)

### Step 2 — AI Evaluation (scored)
Evaluate across:
1) Clarity (what it is / who it is for / why now)
2) Proof (logos, metrics, testimonials, credibility cues)
3) Objections (risk, switching cost, setup time)
4) CTA friction (next step clarity)

### Step 3 — Controlled Revision
- Preserve structure
- Rewrite only: headline, subheadline, CTA block, proof section
- Provide rationale per change

### Step 4 — A/B-ready Variants
Generate 2 variants:
A) Outcome/ROI-driven  
B) Ease-of-use/speed-driven  
Include hypothesis + suggested success metric.

## Why This Works
This turns CRO into an internal operating system: structured inputs, consistent evaluation, controlled rewrites, and testable variants.

## Outcome
- Repeatable weekly CRO workflow
- A/B-ready variants with hypotheses
- Faster iteration and better internal alignment
