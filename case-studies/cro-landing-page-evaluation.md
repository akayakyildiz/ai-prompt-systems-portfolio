# Case 1.1 — CRO Landing Page Optimization (B2B SaaS)

**Role:** Prompt Engineer  
**Industry:** B2B SaaS (generic)

## Problem
The landing page generated traffic, but trial/demo conversion was below expectations. New visitors couldn’t understand the value proposition within the first seconds.

## Context
- Audience: mid-level and executive decision makers
- Constraints:
  - Conversion optimization only (no traffic increase)
  - Existing structure had to be preserved
  - Outputs needed to be A/B-test ready

## Solution (Prompt System)

### Prompt 1 — CRO Evaluation
Role: You are a CRO specialist for B2B SaaS landing pages.  
Task: Evaluate the landing page copy using:
1) Value proposition clarity (first 5 seconds)
2) Trust & proof (social proof, credibility)
3) CTA specificity (clarity and next step)

Output:
- Strengths & weaknesses per criterion
- Top 2 conversion blockers

### Prompt 2 — Revision
Revise the copy based on identified blockers:
- Clarify the value proposition
- Make CTA more specific and action-oriented
- Improve trust elements without exaggeration

Output:
- Revised copy
- Short rationale per change

### Prompt 3 — A/B Variations
Create two alternative variants:
A) Risk reduction  
B) Time/value efficiency  

For each:
- Headline
- Subheadline
- Primary CTA
- Hypothesis being tested

## Why This Works
Instead of one-off creative writing, this system standardizes evaluation → revision → testing. It creates reusable CRO workflows.

## Outcome
- Reusable CRO prompt system
- Clearer messaging and CTAs
- Two A/B-test-ready variants with hypotheses
